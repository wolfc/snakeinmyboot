## EAP XP 4.0.0 Bootable jar with EAP Update and Patch

This project shows how to create an EAP XP 4.0.0 (hollow) bootable jar with an updated EAP base and an one-off applied to it.

Note that the documentation for specifying the EAP base update is wrong as the EAP feature pack itself must be specified explicitly.

To allow this project to run `jbeap-26401.zip` (CVE-2023-1108) fix must be obtained from the customer portal first.
